# This repository is filled with my JavaScript projects and work so far.

Projects include the following:

Pizza Menu: This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings.It then takes the input information and calculate the price for the order.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game: The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls the dice to select which of the two players goes first (User or Computer) and then 
the users are off playing the game.Users can decide which token each player wants to use and the winner is celebrated with music and lights. If the game is a draw,
the game is reset with a sound included.

Calculator: This is a basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
